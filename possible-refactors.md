# Refactoring Opportunities

Based on analysis of the Libros codebase, here are the key refactoring opportunities identified:

## 1. **Duplicate Date Formatting Functions**
- Both `listbooks.go:48` and `detail.go:57` have identical `formatDate`/`formatDateDetail` functions
- **Recommendation**: Extract to a shared utility package or include in styles package as a common helper

## 2. **Repeated Form Input Initialization**
- Similar input setup logic exists in both `addbook.go:44-66` and `edit.go:54-74`
- **Recommendation**: Create a helper function to initialize standard form inputs with consistent styling

## 3. **Duplicated Focus Management Logic** 
- Both AddBook and Edit screens have nearly identical focus handling in their Update methods
- Complex focus navigation logic is repeated in `addbook.go:125-158` and `edit.go:146-185`
- **Recommendation**: Extract focus management into a reusable component or helper

## 4. **Book Type Selection Logic**
- Book type cycling logic is duplicated between add and edit screens
- **Recommendation**: Create a reusable BookTypeSelector component

## 5. **Command Creation Patterns**
- Similar async command patterns (`saveBookCmd`, `updateBookCmd`, `deleteBookCmd`, `loadBooksCmd`)
- **Recommendation**: Consider a command factory pattern or standardized command builder

## 6. **Extensive Comments Could Be Simplified**
- While documentation is excellent, some functions have very verbose comments that could be more concise
- Many comments repeat what the code clearly shows

## 7. **Form Validation**
- Basic validation logic is embedded in database methods (`database.go:104-106`)
- **Recommendation**: Extract validation into dedicated validation functions for reusability

## 8. **Magic Numbers and Constants**
- Hard-coded values like `CharLimit = 255`, `Width = 50`, `SetHeight(4)`, `maxLength = 60` appear throughout
- **Recommendation**: Define these as constants in a configuration package

## 9. **Text Wrapping Logic**
- The `wrapText` function in `detail.go:87-115` could be useful elsewhere
- **Recommendation**: Move to a utilities package for reuse

## 10. **Error Handling Patterns**
- Similar error handling patterns across screens could be standardized
- Consider a consistent error display component

## Overall Assessment

The codebase is well-structured overall with good separation of concerns, but these refactorings would reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
