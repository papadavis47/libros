# Libros - A Davis Family Book Manager

This is the first app I began working on with the help of Claude Code. It has been a fascinating process and I have learned a lot already in a short time.

I like the _flow_ aspect of working with this _agent_ at the terminal. It's fun and creative. Still, it is coding - because I have to be able to read this stuff, but it is so fun to not have to type every single character and still understand the **building** of this little piece of software.

I am going to continue evolving it over time and adding to the functionality with Claude's help.

This has been cool. I like that it is a CLI tool.

Next, I will try working with Amp code.

# Next Day - With Amp Code

I ran out of credits with Claude Code and decided to try Amp Code and I am astounded. This is a very good tool, also. Software engineering is really moving forward with this stuff. I can do **so much more** it is remarkable. And this thing is teaching me patterns about Go I never knew about before.

I am eager to learn more and more about it and with these tools.

The more I use them the more impressed I am and the more I like working with them. It feels like my project ideas can be far more ambitious than before. It's cool. And elite engineering can still exist - but now it can go further and farther.

There will still exist a high end on programming. But now it will feel higher.
