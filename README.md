# Libros - A Davis Family Book Manager

This is the first app I began working on with the help of Claude Code. It has been a fascinating process and I have learned a lot already in a short time.

I like the _flow_ aspect of working with this _agent_ at the terminal. It's fun and creative. Still, it is coding - because I have to be able to read this stuff, but it is so fun to not have to type every single character and still understand the **building** of this little piece of software.

I am going to continue evolving it over time and adding to the functionality with Claude's help.

This has been cool. I like that it is a CLI tool.

Next, I will try working with Amp code.
